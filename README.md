# 🌐 Multi-Cloud Architect Portfolio  
### AWS | Azure | GCP | Data Engineering | Analytics | Machine Learning | IaC (Terraform)

Welcome to my **Multi-Cloud Architect Portfolio**, a complete, job-ready, end-to-end enterprise architecture project designed to showcase deep expertise across **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

This repository contains a full real-world case study built for a fictional global retailer, **NovaRetail**, including:

- Multi-cloud architecture diagrams & documentation  
- Data engineering + ETL/ELT pipelines  
- Big data & analytics platform design  
- Machine learning deployment strategy  
- Terraform IaC for all three clouds  
- Production-grade operations, governance, DR, and security  

Everything is **fully written, complete, and production-quality** — no placeholders.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design a **scalable, secure, enterprise multi-cloud platform** that leverages each cloud's strengths:

| Cloud | Role in Architecture |
|-------|------------------------|
| **AWS** | Primary data lake, ingestion, streaming, ETL (Glue), Redshift analytics |
| **Azure** | Business intelligence hub (ADF, ADLS, Synapse, Power BI) |
| **GCP** | ML & advanced analytics (BigQuery, Vertex AI, Dataflow) |

The architecture supports **Customer 360**, real-time analytics, ML-driven fraud detection, recommendation models, and full cross-cloud data flows.
