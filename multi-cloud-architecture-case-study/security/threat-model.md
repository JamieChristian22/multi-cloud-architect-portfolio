- Misconfigured storage buckets, exposing data publicly.
- Compromised credentials or service accounts.
- Data tampering in transit between clouds.
- Ransomware attacks or destructive insiders.

Mitigations:

- Regular security scans and configuration audits.
- Immutable logs and versioned storage for recovery.
